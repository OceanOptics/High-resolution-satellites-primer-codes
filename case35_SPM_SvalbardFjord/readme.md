## Case 3.5 for SPM in Svalbard: compare SPM from Landsat-8 (level 2, collection 2) USGS product and from Landsat 8 (level 2, atmospherically corrected using ACOLITE processor)

##### This module provides a package of Matlab functions to estimates SPM using a multiple-wavelength algorithm (MW algorithm, Tavora et al., 2020).
We strongly recommend to not use level 2 satellite imagery from USGS as this product is not ideal for water color applications.


The codes here are likely not the fastest implementation possible however are easy to use.
