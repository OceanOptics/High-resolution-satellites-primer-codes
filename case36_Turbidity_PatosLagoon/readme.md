## Case 3.6 for Turbidity in Patos Lagoon: compare and validate Turbidity from Landsat-5, Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9


This module provides a package of Matlab functions to sample Turbidity data from Landsat scenes processed with ACOLITE . 
The codes here are likely not the fastest implementation possible however are easy to use.

###### Step01*:
finds matchups between in-situ sampled Turbidity and Landsat whithin 30min between satellite overpass and sampling. 

###### Step02*:
samples Turbidity derived from L5, L7, L8, and L9 at one specific station (buoy RS4)

###### plot_figure*:
plots all gathered data from previous functions.
